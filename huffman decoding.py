"""Restore the string from its code and a prefix-free symbols code.
In a first line of the input file there are given two integers k and l in a space â€”
amount of unique letters in a string and length of encoded string.
In a next k lines there are letters codes in a "letter: code" format. no one code is a prefix of another.
Letters may be shown in any order. All letters are lowercase letters of a Latin alphabet
and each of these letters can be found at least once in a string.
At last in a last line there is an encoded string. The input string and letters codes are not empty.
The input code allows to have the minimum length of the encoded string.
In a first output line show the decoded string s. It should consist of a lowercase letters of a LAtin alphabet.
It is guaranteed that the length of the right answer does not exceed 10**4 symbols.
